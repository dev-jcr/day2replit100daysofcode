Did you notice the space in the variable name? We never put spaces in variable names - it just confuses the poor computer!

- What we're trying to print out is *NOT* the same as what we set the varaible up as in the first place. The **capitalization** is different.  `myGrandma` versus `mygrandma`

- This is also important when you try to print out a variable that you haven't created yet. You must ALWAYS create the variable BEFORE you print it out.

## This is just plain weird...
You won't get an error from this one, but the output won't make a lot of sense...

ðŸ‘‰ Copy this code and `run` it to see what happens.
```python
myLunch = input("What are you having for lunch? ")
print("Hmm, it sounds like you really should just order")
print("myLunch")
print("as soon as possible!")
```


```
What are you having for lunch? Burrito
Hmm, it sounds like you really should just order
myLunch
as soon as possible!
```

- You've tried to print a variable, but added in quotes! 
- Remember: quotes will ***literally*** print out whatever you stick in them.
- In this case it's printing the variable name instead of the contents of the variable.
- If you want the contents, then you DO NOT USE QUOTES.
