# Fix My Code
ðŸ‘‰ Try and fix this code which is *full* of errors.

*First, delete any other code in your `main.py` file. Copy each code snippet below into `main.py` by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit `run` and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press `run` again until you are error free. Click on the `ðŸ‘€ Answer` to compare your code to the correct code.*

**Please note: This is a silly example. You'd never write your own Phishing code, but it's really important to know what to look for. If someone's asking you for this kind of information online - think twice!**

```python
print("Definitely not a Phishing Scam")
print()
input("Your Name")
print("Thanks for logging in")
print(myName)
cardNumber = input("What is your credit card number?")
print("Thanks, I definitely wont put")
print("cardNumber")
print("into Amazon and order anything weird")
print()
print("Promise")
maidenName input("What is your Mother's maiden name? ")
print()
print("That's cool, I just wanted to know that")
print(maidenName)
print("was your Mum's maiden name. Not because the bank requested it or anything, honest.")
```
